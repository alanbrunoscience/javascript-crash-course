 * Character access

 * You can access a specific character in a string by using the square brackets syntax [].
 * 
 * You have to provide the index of the character that you'd like to access, starting from 0.
 * 
 * Let's take an example where the variable language has the value: "JavaScript". Here's how you access the 1st character, the 2nd, 
 * and the 3rd.
