/**
 * Arrays
 * 
 * - Arrays in JavaScript allow you to store multiple elements in the same variable. You can store numbers, strings, booleans,
 * arrays, objects & more. These can be mixed within the same array.
 * 
 * - Here are some examples:
 */

const users = []; // empty arrays
const grades = [10, 8, 13, 15]; // array of numbers
const attendees = ["Sam", "Alex"]; // array of strings
const values = [10, false, "John"]; // mixed

// Name arrays in the plural as they can contain more than one item. This will prove to be especially useful once we need to 
// iterate over an array.
