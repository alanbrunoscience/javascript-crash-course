Can I use 'var'?

→ When you're browsing the Internet for documentation, or Questions & Answers on StackOverflow, you will see a lot of
code snippets using 'var' instead of 'let' & 'const'.

→ Even though 'var' still works, its usage is discouraged as it may be confusing in a lot of scenarios. So you can simply
replace 'var' with 'let' (or 'const' if the variable is not being reassigned).

*** Legacy note ***

→ Avoid using 'var' when defining variables. Use 'let' or 'const' instead.

→ A thorough explanation of why you should avoid 'var' is available towards the end of the course. We follow a unique 
approach in this course where we teach you modern JavaScript before uncovering the legacy and it has worked quite well 
for most of our students!
