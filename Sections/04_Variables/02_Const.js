/**
 * A note about const
 * 
 * An important note about const is that it does not create a Constant or an Immutable value. This will be thoroughly explained once 
 * we learn about arrays & objects. What you need to know, for now, is that you can only use the equal sign once, but you can still 
 * change elements inside an array or object.
