/**
 * Returning booleans
 * 
 * - Whenever you're returning a boolean (true or false), it's quite redundant to use if and else.
 * Here's an example:
 */

function isPassing(grade) {
  if (grade >= 10) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}

console.log(isPassing(12));

// This is redundant because grade >= 10 on its own, evaluates to true or false depending on 
// the grade. This means you don't need to wrap it with an if/else statement. That's why you 
// can refactor it like this:

function isPassing2(grade) {
  return grade >= 10;
}

console.log(isPassing2(9));

// without using if/else which will always return a boolean!

// This only works whenever you're returning a boolean from a function.
